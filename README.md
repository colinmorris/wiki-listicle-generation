A hacky experiment in semi-automatically creating a Wikipedia list article using data from Wikidata, and Wikipedia categories. Target first article is "List of gay novels prior to the Stonewall riots".

* `scrape_gay_novel_data.py` grabs all pages in Wikipedia's "Novels with gay themes" category, and fetches the corresponding Wikidata item. Writes results to `noveldat.json`.
* `write_listicle.py` generates a file containing wikitext table populated with data from `noveldat.json`

`prematter.wiki` and `postmatter.wiki` contain hand-written wikitext to precede and follow the generated table. The final article is the result of catting them with the table generated by `write_listicle.py` sandwiched in the middle.
