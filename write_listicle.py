NOTES = {
    "Joseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania": "The title characters have a close, affectionate friendship, but are not physically intimate, and both have romantic relationships with women. Scholars disagree as to whether the story should be understood as having a gay subtext.",
    "The Sins of the Cities of the Plain": "A pornographic novel purporting to be the memoirs of a male prostitute.",
    "O Ateneu": "Depicts [[situational homosexuality]] among students in an all-male boarding school.",
    "The Picture of Dorian Gray": "The novel's allusions to homosexuality and homosexual desire were seen as scandalous when it was first published serially in [[Lippincott's Monthly Magazine]]. Wilde subsequently made several revisions to excise homoerotic themes before the work was published in book format. An unexpurgated version was published in 2011 which further included passages deleted by an editor at Lippincott's before initial publication.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/27/dorian-gray-oscar-wilde-uncensored</ref>",
    "Teleny, or The Reverse of the Medal": "Pornographic novel published anonymously. Believed to be the work of multiple authors, possibly including [[Oscar Wilde]].",
    "Imre: A Memorandum": "Notable for being among the earliest sympathetic portrayals of homosexuality. The main characters, lovers Imre and Oswald, are happy and united at the end of the story. Only a small printing of 500 copies was issued in Italy (Stevenson was an American writing in Europe). Reissued in 2003.",
    "Death in Venice": "The main character, an aging writer, develops an infatuation with a beautiful adolescent boy. Subject of a number of adaptations, most notably a [[Death in Venice (film)|1971 film]] by [[Luchino Visconti]].",
    "The Charioteer": "Due to its positive portrayal of homosexuality, it was not able to be published in the US until 1959. Renault would continue to explore homosexual themes in her later novels - beginning with the 1956 ''The Last of the Wine'' - but using an Ancient Greek setting to evade censorship.",
    "The Last of the Wine": "The first of several historical novels that Renault would write which dealt with homosexuality in an Ancient Greek setting.",
    "City of Night": "Follows a [[Male prostitution|hustler]] in his travels across America. Includes discussion of the [[Cooper Do-nuts Riot]], an early event in the gay liberation movement, seen as a precursor to the [[Stonewall riots]].",
    "Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone": "A retrospective examination of the life and relationships of a bisexual black man from [[Harlem]].",
    "In Search of Lost Time": "Some critics surmise that the narrator is presented as a closeted homosexual. The first chapter of the fourth volume includes a detailed account of a sexual encounter between two men. Proust himself was gay, but not publicly.",
    "Quatrefoil: A Modern Novel": "Among the first novels to favourably portray homosexuality.",
